# Belief Propagation

In the frame of the course Graphical Models discrete inference and learning, we implemented Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) and Supervised Belief Propagation (SBP) from the paper "Supervised Belief Propagation: Scalable Supervised Inference on Attributed Networks"  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8215532  on the MoovieLens dataset mentioned in the report.

- Graphical models implementation can be found in the file graph_models.py
- LBP and SBP implementations can be found in belief_propagation.py
- main.ipynb is a notebook allowing to run the implemented methods. More experiments can be added from the methods in belief_propagation.py
